I used a tree with a dictionart to store the characters and their apperance.

I need a sorting method and I achieved it with a use of an array containing the keys
which was then sorted.

The tree enabled the derivation of the codes for each distinct letter and the letters and 
codes are also stored as a key value pair in a dictionary for easy access.

Time complexity
superlinear O(n * nlogn)
the create_tree() is recursive
use of sorted function for each call makes it this way


Space complexity
linear O(n)
n is the input size because
array is proportional to the size
