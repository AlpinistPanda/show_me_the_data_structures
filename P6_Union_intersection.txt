UNION

I am using sets to store the unique nodes from a linkedlist
Then I create a union linkedlist if that is empty there is no union


Time complexity
linear O(n)
because we search through each node from 1 to n

Space complexity
linear O(n)
scale of the dataset grows as the size of the input increases


INTERSECTION

I am using sets to store unique nodes
I intersect the two sets and if there is no intersection the solution is empty


Time complexity
O(n)
because we search through each node from 1 to n


Space complexity
linear O(n)
