I used recursion to travers a directory and its subdirectories to find files with suffix.


Time complexity
quadratic O(n * m)
n is the number of files in the current directory
m is the number of folders

Space complexity
O(n * m)
n is the depth of recursion
m is the space each recursive call function occupies.

result list O(n) but it is neglected
