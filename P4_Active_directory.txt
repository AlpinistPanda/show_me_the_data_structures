I used recursion to search all groups present in a group to find a user.

Time complexity
quadratic O(n * m)
n is the number of users
m is the number of subgroups

Space complexity
quadratic O(n * m)
n is the depth of recursion
m is the space each recursive call function occupies

There is also linear component coming from list search however they are negligble as the most dominant term comes from
recursion
